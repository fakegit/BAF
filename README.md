Blind Attacking Framework

* version [0.2.0] --> [(public releases).(beta versions).(bugfixes patches)]

* this framework is under  AGPLv3 license 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
what is BAF ? 
* it's a framework written in python [2.7] that is being made specially for blind attacking , ie : attacking random targets with common security issues , targets are currently generated by the hackers search engine <a href="https://www.shodan.io/explore">"shodan"</a> and vulnerable hosts are hacked in an automated way .

* this framework is completely "neutral" ie: it will not based on a search engine API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what can be done is contributers skills/immagination & search engines availability as web apps .   


why BAF ? 
* because blind attacking makes every vulnerable & exposed  host to the internet a targeted one , hence increases the awareness of potential threats
* because the best way to prevent knowlege abuse under the hood is sharing it with everyone 
* because it will always add new to the community and will never be a replica 


what is new in the 2nd beta version BAF 0.2.0 ?
* BAF authentication : it provides free access to all shodan premium account's results through BAF authentication server which uses a premium accounts chain to balance the users load/authenticate with shodan web app
* BAF became totally invisible with no browser head using phantomjs as the webdriver instead of firefox 
* telnet agent & webcam agent are transfered to vulnerability assessment module so stay tuned for them in the upcoming releases ISA ^_^ 


 how a pubic release (free/pro version) looks like ? "just an appetizer :) "  
* it will have modules which contain agents 
  1- searching module: built on shodan , cynsys (free version) & zmap,zgrap,massscan (pro version) , it's overall aim is to crawl the whole internet searching for vulnerable targets ,....etc
  2- vulnerability assessment module : which will make sure "on a local machine" that hosts found based on a specific search criteria     are vulnerable . (it will integrate with metasploit and kali linux tools) ,...etc
  3-exploitation module : it will run predefined/custom exloits against vulnerable targets (also will integrate with metasploit and kali      linux tools) ,...etc
  4- post exploitation module : it will harvest exploited targets and will either produce a report to be sent to the host owners with   a POC of the exploit or add the host to a private botnet ,....etc
  
 REMEMBER !! it's just the appetizer :)

how to use BAF ? 
* fire up a terminal and sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade
* install [ requests , httplib , urllib , time , bs4 "BeautifulSoup" , colored , selenium , sys ] python modules 
* python BAF_0.1.0.py
* use BAF authentication to atomatically authenticate with shodan via premium account to get access to all search results or enter your shodan's account username and pass for custom account login 
* choose 1 , let it do it's job , press y , close the previous tab , press y ,close the previous tabs ...etc till u have the vulnerable        cams only 
* choose 2 , enter what do u want to search for (ie: NSA) , when it's done , refer to the targets text file , it will contain the targets ip:port
* that's all , till now :)
* DON'T close a loading webpage 
* beta versions will make automated browser open for better understanding ,but you can close the webcam tabs freely

how to contribute? 

the framework is under development so both testers and contributers are more than welcome to help ... so , 
* active testers and bug reporters can help us developing the TODO list of the framework & enjoy watching their TODO wishes - next to    their names - come true :) 
* contributers who provide merged <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">pull requests</a> will be listed below and in the framework contributers section .
* contributers who provide (continuous - dramatic) <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">merged pull requests</a> will be owners and they will have a share in the pro version profit 

how can a pull request be definitely merged?
* adds new from the TODO 
* patces bugs from the TODO
