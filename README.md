Blind Attacking Framework

* version [0.2.0] --> [(public releases).(beta versions).(bugfixes patches)]

* this framework is under  AGPLv3 license 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
what is BAF ? 
* it's a framework written in python [2.7] that is being made specially for blind attacking , ie : attacking random targets with common security issues , targets are currently generated by the hackers search engine <a href="https://www.shodan.io/explore">"shodan"</a> and vulnerable hosts are hacked in an automated way .

* this framework is completely "neutral" ie: it will not based on a search engine API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what can be done is contributers skills/immagination & search engines availability as web apps .   


why BAF ? 
* because blind attacking makes every vulnerable & exposed  host to the internet a targeted one , hence increases the awareness of potential threats
* because the best way to prevent knowlege abuse under the hood is sharing it with everyone 
* because it will always add new to the community and will never be a replica 


what is new in the 2nd beta version BAF 0.2.0 ?
* BAF authentication : it provides free access to all shodan premium account's results through BAF authentication server which uses a premium accounts chain to balance the users load/authenticate with shodan web app
* BAF became totally invisible with no browser head using phantomjs as the webdriver instead of firefox 
* telnet agent & webcam agent are transfered to vulnerability assessment module so stay tuned for them in the upcoming releases ISA ^_^ 

how to use BAF ? 
* fire up a terminal and sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade
* install [ requests , httplib , urllib , time , bs4 "BeautifulSoup" , colored , selenium , sys ] python modules 
* python BAF_0.1.0.py
* use BAF authentication to atomatically authenticate with shodan via premium account to get access to all search results or enter your shodan's account username and pass for custom account login 
* choose 1 , let it do it's job , press y , close the previous tab , press y ,close the previous tabs ...etc till u have the vulnerable        cams only 
* choose 2 , enter what do u want to search for (ie: NSA) , when it's done , refer to the targets text file , it will contain the targets ip:port
* that's all , till now :)
* DON'T close a loading webpage 
* beta versions will make automated browser open for better understanding ,but you can close the webcam tabs freely
